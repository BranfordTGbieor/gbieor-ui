      "Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid releases.",
      "In an agile approach, some planning and design is done upfront, but the development proceeds in small batches and involves close collaboration with stakeholders. Changes are incorporated continuously and a usable version of a product is often released quicker compared to products developed through the waterfall methodology. This provides many benefits, with arguably the most important being that if software doesnâ€™t meet the needs or expectations of the customer, it  can be remediated in real-time.",
      "Agile is a collection of methodologies, not a single approach to development. It is an aggregation of scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), and other systems of practice that developers used in years prior, and resulted from those practitioners coming together to unify these approaches into a single set of principles.",
